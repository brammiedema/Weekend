-- Working on Main, Product and Voorraad Class (16.46)     --done

-- Did the first part, next updates should be more functionality in products and cart + productorder






-- Be careful not to use instance variables in Product class; bit confusing, but that's the assignment. Adding the function setStock to the Product class seems useless.


-- We need to look at best access modifiers at the end.. and perhaps at certain times in between.
