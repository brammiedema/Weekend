Repository voor de weekendopdracht van YCP java traineeship maart 2016




19-03

-- Working on Main, Product and Voorraad Class (16.45)     --done

-- Working on ProductOrder and Cart (19.45)








-- Did the first part, next updates should be more functionality in products and cart + productorder





-- Be careful not to use instance variables in Product class; bit confusing, but that's the assignment. Implementing the function setStock to the Product class seems useless.


-- We need to look at best access modifiers at the end.. and perhaps at certain times in between.
